- The Hoor game lives in `src/game/` (ported from a Vite SPA) and renders client-only from `/` via `ClientOnly` + lazy import, because it reads localStorage during state initialization.
- Extra-strict TS flags (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, noImplicitReturns) are off: the ported game code was written without them.
- Offline uses vite-plugin-pwa generateSW writing `dist/client/sw.js`; `src/game/pwa-register.ts` is the only registrar and refuses dev/iframe/Lovable preview hosts, because a SW in preview serves stale builds.
- AI practice recommendations (src/lib/practice.*) may only pick topic ids from src/game/data/practiceCatalog.ts; questions always come from the tested local generator, so the model never writes questions. Requires sign-in to protect AI credits.
